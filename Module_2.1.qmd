### LOS 2.a: Calculate and interpret the present value (PV) of fixed-income and equity instruments based on expected future cash flows

The **present value (PV)** is the current worth of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows given a specific rate of return.  
The **future value (FV)** represents how much a present sum will grow to in the future, assuming it earns a constant return rate.

---

### Relationship Between Present and Future Value

$$
FV = PV(1 + r)^t
$$

$$
PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^t} = FV(1 + r)^{-t}
$$

where:  
- $r$ = interest rate per compounding period  
- $t$ = number of compounding periods  

If we are using **continuous compounding**, the relationship becomes:

$$
FV = PV \times e^{rt}
$$

$$
PV = FV \times e^{-rt}
$$

### Fixed-Income Securities

A **pure discount debt instrument**, such as a **zero-coupon bond**, provides a simple example of the **time value of money**.  
The investor pays less than the face value to buy the instrument and receives the face value at maturity.  
The **price** depends on the **yield to maturity (YTM)** and **time to maturity**.  
The **interest earned** is the difference between the face value and purchase price.

---

### Example — Zero-Coupon Bond

A zero-coupon bond with a **face value of \$1,000** will mature **15 years from today**.  
The bond has a **yield to maturity of 4%** with **annual compounding**.  
What is the bond’s price?

$$
PV = \frac{1,000}{(1 + 0.04)^{15}} = \$555.26
$$

---

### Finding Yield from Price (BA II Plus)

If we are given the **price** of \$555.26, the **face value** of \$1,000, and **annual compounding** over **15 years**, enter:

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------:|
| PV | –555.26 |
| FV | 1,000 |
| PMT | 0 |
| N | 15 |
| CPT → I/Y | 4.00% |

**Result:** The bond’s yield to maturity (YTM) is **4.00%**.

> **Professor’s Note:**  
> Enter **cash outflows as negative values** and **cash inflows as positive values**.  
> From the investor’s perspective, **PV (purchase price)** is an **outflow**, and **FV (face value)** is an **inflow**.

---

### Negative Interest Rates

In some circumstances, interest rates can be **negative**.  
A **zero-coupon bond with a negative yield** will be **priced at a premium** (price > face value).

---

### Example — Zero-Coupon Bond with Negative Yield

If the bond in the previous example has a **yield to maturity of –0.5%**, with **annual compounding**, the price is:

$$
PV = \frac{1,000}{(1 - 0.005)^{15}} = \$1,078.09
$$

---

### Fixed-Coupon Bonds

A **fixed-coupon bond** provides periodic **coupon payments** in addition to the **face value** at maturity.  
The **coupon rate** determines the coupon payment, while the **yield to maturity (YTM)** determines the discount rate used for valuation.

For example, a **3% annual coupon**, **\$1,000 par** bond pays  
$$30 = 3\% \times 1,000$$  
each year.

> **Note:**  
> The **coupon rate** determines **PMT**, not the discount rate.  
> The **YTM** (I/Y) is the rate implied by the bond’s **price**.

---

### Example — Annual Coupon Bond

Consider a **10-year**, **\$1,000 par**, **10% annual coupon bond**.  
What is the value of this bond if its **yield to maturity is 8%**?

**Step 1:** Compute annual cash flows.  
Coupon payments = 10% × \$1,000 = \$100 per year.

**Step 2:** Discount all cash flows to present value.

$$
PV = \frac{100}{1.08} + \frac{100}{(1.08)^2} + \frac{100}{(1.08)^3} + \dots + \frac{100}{(1.08)^9} + \frac{1,100}{(1.08)^{10}}
$$

$$
PV = \$1,134.20
$$

---

### BA II Plus Solution

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------:|
| N | 10 |
| PMT | 100 |
| FV | 1,000 |
| I/Y | 8 |
| CPT → PV | –1,134.20 |

**Result:** The bond’s value is **\$1,134.20**.

### Professor’s Note

For this reading, where we want to illustrate **time value of money** concepts, we are only using **annual coupon payments** and **compounding periods**.  
In the **Fixed Income** topic area, we will also perform these calculations for **semiannual-pay bonds**.

---

### Perpetuities

Some bonds have **no maturity date**.  
We refer to these as **perpetual bonds** or **perpetuities**.  
Because perpetuities never mature, we cannot define a meaningful **future value**, but their **present value** simplifies mathematically to:

$$
PV_{\text{perpetuity}} = \frac{\text{payment}}{r}
$$

---

### Amortizing Bonds and Annuities

An **amortizing bond** pays a **level amount each period**, including its final maturity payment.  
Each payment includes **both interest and principal**, unlike a **fixed-coupon bond**, which returns the **entire principal** at maturity.

Amortizing bonds are examples of **annuity instruments**.  
For an **annuity**, the periodic payment can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Annuity Payment} = \frac{r \times PV}{1 - (1 + r)^{-t}}
$$

where:  
- $r$ = interest rate per period  
- $t$ = number of periods  
- $PV$ = present value (principal)

---

### Example — Computing a Loan Payment

Suppose you are considering applying for a **\$2,000 loan** that will be repaid with **equal end-of-year payments** over the next **13 years**.  
If the annual interest rate is **6%**, what is the size of each payment?

We can compute the **payment (PMT)** using the given values.  
Since the loan will be fully repaid, **FV = 0**.

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------:|
| N | 13 |
| I/Y | 6 |
| PV | –2,000 |
| FV | 0 |
| CPT → PMT | 225.92 |

**Result:** The end-of-year payment is **\$225.92**.

---

### Equity Securities

Just as with fixed-income securities, we value **equity securities** (such as **common** and **preferred stock**) as the **present value of their expected future cash flows**.  
However, **equity securities** differ in two important ways:  
1. They **do not mature**.  
2. Their **cash flows may change** over time.

---

### Preferred Stock Valuation

Preferred stock pays a **fixed dividend**, usually stated as a **percentage of par value**.  
The investor’s **required return** is the **discount rate** used to value the stock.

Because preferred dividends are **fixed and indefinite**, we can use the **perpetuity formula**:

$$
V_{\text{preferred}} = \frac{D_p}{k_p}
$$

where:  
- $D_p$ = dividend per period  
- $k_p$ = required return on the preferred stock

---

### Example — Preferred Stock Valuation

A company’s **\$100 par preferred stock** pays a **\$5 annual dividend** and has a **required return of 8%**.  
Calculate the value of the preferred stock.

$$
V_{\text{preferred}} = \frac{5.00}{0.08} = \$62.50
$$

**Result:** The preferred stock’s value is **\$62.50**.

---

### Common Stock Valuation

Common stock represents a **residual claim** on a company’s assets after all obligations are met.  
Unlike preferred stock, it **does not promise fixed dividends** — the company’s management decides **if and when** dividends are paid.

Because cash flows are **uncertain**, analysts use **dividend discount models (DDMs)** to estimate value.  
We focus on three key versions:

1. **Constant Dividend (Perpetuity)** — dividends are constant forever.  
2. **Constant Growth (Gordon Growth Model)** — dividends grow at a constant rate.  
3. **Multistage Growth** — dividends grow at varying rates before stabilizing.

---

### 1. Constant Dividend (Perpetuity)

If dividends remain **constant forever**, we use the **perpetuity formula**:

$$
V_0 = \frac{D}{k_e}
$$

---

### 2. Constant Growth Model (Gordon Growth Model)

If dividends are expected to grow at a **constant rate**, the value of a stock is:

$$
V_0 = \frac{D_1}{k_e - g_c}
$$

where:  
- $V_0$ = current value of the stock  
- $D_1$ = dividend expected next period  
- $k_e$ = required return on equity  
- $g_c$ = constant growth rate of dividends  

> Note: $k_e$ must be **greater than** $g_c$ for the model to work.

---

### Example — Gordon Growth Model Valuation

Calculate the value of a stock expected to pay a **\$1.62 dividend next year**, with dividends growing at **8% forever**, and a **required return of 12%**.

$$
V_0 = \frac{1.62}{0.12 - 0.08} = \$40.50
$$

**Result:** The stock’s value is **\$40.50**.

---

### 3. Multistage Dividend Discount Model (DDM)

If a stock experiences **changing dividend growth**, we use the **multistage DDM**.  
This assumes **high short-term growth** followed by **constant long-term growth**.

Steps:  
1. Estimate short-term dividends individually.  
2. Apply the **constant growth model** starting from the first dividend that grows at the constant rate.  
3. Discount all cash flows back to present value.

---

### Example — Multistage Growth

A stock’s dividends are expected to **grow at 15% per year for two years**, then **5% per year indefinitely**.  
The **last dividend paid (D₀)** was **\$1.00**, and the **required return (kₑ)** is **11%**.  
Find the value of the stock.

**Step 1 — Compute high-growth dividends**

$$
D_1 = D_0(1 + g^*) = 1.00(1.15) = 1.15
$$

$$
D_2 = D_1(1 + g^*) = 1.15(1.15) = 1.32
$$

**Step 2 — Find terminal value (P₁)** using the constant growth model from D₂ onward:

$$
P_1 = \frac{D_2}{k_e - g_c} = \frac{1.32}{0.11 - 0.05} = 22.00
$$

**Step 3 — Discount D₁ and P₁ back to present**

$$
V_0 = \frac{1.15 + 22.00}{1.11} = \$20.86
$$

**Result:** The value of the stock today is **\$20.86**.

---

### Professor’s Note

When we apply the **dividend in Period 2** to the **constant growth model**, it yields a **value for the stock in Period 1**.  
To obtain the **current value (V₀)**, we must **discount that value back one period**, along with any earlier dividends **not included** in the constant growth portion.
