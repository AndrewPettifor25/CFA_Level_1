# Module 1.1 Interest Rates and Return Measurement

## LOS 1.a — Interpreting Interest Rates

::: {.callout-note title="Learning Objective"}
Interpret interest rates as required rates of return, discount rates, or opportunity costs, and explain an interest rate as the sum of a real risk-free rate and risk premiums.

### 1. Understanding Interest Rates

Interest rates represent the **time value of money** — the compensation investors require for deferring consumption.

They can be interpreted in three equivalent ways:

- **Required rate of return:** the minimum return that investors demand to lend funds.  
- **Discount rate:** the rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows.  
- **Opportunity cost:** the return forgone by consuming now instead of saving or investing.

In equilibrium, the interest rate equals the **market’s required rate of return**, ensuring that lenders and borrowers are willing to transact.

### 2. The Real Risk-Free Rate

The **real risk-free rate** is a **theoretical rate** on a single-period, riskless loan with:

- No expectation of inflation, and  
- Zero probability of default.

It reflects **time preference for consumption** — the degree to which individuals prefer current consumption to future consumption.

---

### 3. Nominal vs. Real Rates

Because inflation erodes purchasing power, investors demand an **inflation premium** in addition to the real risk-free rate.

The relationship between nominal and real rates is:

$$
(1 + r_{\text{nominal}}) = (1 + r_{\text{real}})(1 + \pi_{\text{expected}})
$$

A common approximation used throughout the CFA curriculum is:

$$
r_{\text{nominal}} \approx r_{\text{real}} + \pi_{\text{expected}}
$$

Where:  
- \( r_{\text{real}} \) = Real risk-free rate  
- \( \pi_{\text{expected}} \) = Expected inflation rate

### 4. Risk Premiums

Real-world securities often carry additional risks. Investors demand **risk premiums** to compensate for these:

| **Risk Type** | **Definition** | **Premium Added** |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Default Risk** | The risk the borrower fails to make payments as promised. | Default Risk Premium (DRP) |
| **Liquidity Risk** | The risk of selling an asset below fair value when quick sale is needed. | Liquidity Premium (LP) |
| **Maturity Risk** | The risk that longer-term bonds fluctuate more in price than shorter-term ones. | Maturity Premium (MP) |

---

### 5. Complete Interest Rate Structure

The nominal interest rate on a security combines all these elements:

$$
r_{\text{nominal}} = r_{\text{real}} + \pi_{\text{expected}} + \text{DRP} + \text{LP} + \text{MP}
$$

### ✅ Key Takeaway

> Interest rates reflect both the **time value of money** and **compensation for bearing risk**.  
> The **real risk-free rate** is the foundation, while risk premiums account for inflation, default, liquidity, and maturity.
